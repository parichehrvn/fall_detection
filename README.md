# fall_detection
A computer vision-based fall detection system that uses pose estimation and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to identify falls in videos. The system processes 15-frame sliding windows, extracts normalized joint locations from 17 keypoints using pose estimation, and applies TCNs for accurate and efficient fall detection.
